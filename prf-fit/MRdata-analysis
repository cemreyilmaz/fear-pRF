After data collection:
1 - prepT1.m to create NII file for structural image (for each session separately).
2 - AverageT1.m to create an averaged structural image for the subject.
3 - recon-all to perform reconstruction of structural data by using FreeSurfer for each session and averaged T1.
4 - twocoreg.m for functional preprocessing and pRF fit.
Note: aps_Ridge.mat includes the binary stimulus presentation. You can check the stimulus movie with ViewApertures in MATLAB. It is used for pRF fit.


## recon-all ##
The analysis start with prepT1.m. You can personalize the code for your special needs.

Then, [subjectName]_T1.nii file will be saved as output by the code into FSFolder that you specified. 
You can start FreeSurfer anatomical processing by using the following code. This step will be done using terminal.

# to install freesurfer
tcsh 
setenv FREESURFER_HOME /Applications/freesurfer
source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.csh

# go to the FSFolder. Don't forget to change the subjectName. 
# Takes ~8-10 hours. You may leave the computer overnight.
cd /Applications/freesurfer/subjects
recon-all -i erf04_T1.nii -s erf04 -all

# rearrange the output
cd /Applications/freesurfer/subjects/erf04/mri
mri_convert --out_orientation RAS -rt nearest orig.mgz erf04.nii

# take the average of three sessions BEFORE functional analyses!

cd /Applications/freesurfer/subjects
make_average_subject --out erf02 --subjects ERF02sc ERF02neutr ERF02sc

cd /Applications/freesurfer/subjects/erf02/mri
mri_convert --out_orientation RAS -rt nearest orig.mgz erf02.nii
